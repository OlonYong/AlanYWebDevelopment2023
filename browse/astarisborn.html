		<h1 class="heading">My review</h1>
			<p id="review">
				An absolutely incredible movie that looks at important issues like substance abuse, suicide and what fame can do to a person. Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper truly deliver strong emotions in their performances throughout. The soundtrack for the film is so heartwarming and listening to the songs takes you back and reminds you of the story of Jackson and Ally. <br><br>
				Both Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper's vocals are incredible, and the lyrics of the songs Gaga and Cooper wrote (with other songwriter's) for the film are so beautifully written to put into words the relationship between Jackson and Ally, and their journeys both together and separately. <br><br>
				
				Cooper did an incredible job directing, co-producing, starring, singing and playing the guitar and piano. His portrayal was so captivating and believable!
				
				Gaga's acting was amazing, especially considering this is her first time in a starring role. It was so lovely seeing Gaga without make-up (not that she isn't lovely with it) and I really loved her portrayal of Ally and the emotions she put into Ally and the way Ally sings in that last scene (the emotions - just wow) it was so breathtakingly beautiful! <br><br>
				
				My favourite thing about the film is the whole movie is about, well, a star (Ally portrayed by Lady Gaga) being "born" through Jackson (portrayed by Bradley Cooper) and how her rise to fame is because Jackson believed in her and saw her talent and he made sure that she showed her talent to the world. I loved that Jackson got Ally to sing her song and never gave up on her, also that Ally was there for Jackson at his worst moments (well besides the suicide) and that she tried to get him to stop drinking and taking drugs (which he did for a small period of time).
				They had up's and down's but stayed at each other's side always. <br><br>
				It's a beautiful but heartbreaking story that truly centres around the fact that Jackson helped a star (Ally) be born (ha-ha see what I did there). Everything they went through together and apart all led up to that final scene where Ally looks straight into the camera, because that's when she knows she's made it in the industry, that she is a star.
