			<p id="review">
				Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is the fifth and final instalment of the Indiana Jones franchise with Harrison Ford playing the lead character. Fans have had to wait 15 years after Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but the box office seems to have drunk from the wrong cup. <br><br>

				Overall, the movie can be entertaining with its action and comedic moments. All the visual effects including the de-aging of Harrison Ford look good and capture the feel of the era it is set in. The movie is a lot of what has already been seen before and yet it wouldn't resonate with the younger generation if they haven't been following the franchise. This movie is directed by James Mangold rather than Steven Spielberg, so it is a different style from the other movies. Harrison Ford was around 77 - 80 years old while making this movie and the movie is also skewed towards older audiences. But I think it can also be positive for younger people to feel that the adventure doesn't have to be over when we get older. There could be exciting things to explore in the future as well. <br><br>
				
				The movie has all the classic Indiana Jones elements, including the whip and punches, and is like Star Wars: The Force Awakens in many ways. Like the other films, this one is based on real-world mythology with fictional concepts mixed in. While the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was about inter-dimensional beings, Dial of Destiny is about mathematics, time travel and Greek history. Mads Mikkelsen plays the villain and is a Nazi but there is a twist about his motivations which gets revealed in the third act. <br><br>
				
				An interesting thing about time travel in this movie is that there is no time machine. The Antikythera made by Archimedes only calculates the location of 'fissuresâ€™ in time which can be used to travel to different locations in time. These 'fissures' in time are like the concept of wormholes in physics. And the wormholes are clearly visible to ordinary people. The villain of the movie has much more confidence that Antikythera works than Indiana Jones himself. But the past isn't changed by going to the past as their actions have taken effect even before they commit them. So, it is a bit of a paradox. <br><br>
				
				As Indiana Jones is an archaeologist he wants to stay in the past and accept his fate, but his goddaughter is adamant that he doesn't belong here. In the previous movie, the final act is always a dangerous situation that he must escape from. This time there is a Roman war going on, but he is still excited to see it like he is in a dream. There are a lot of things that happen conveniently to push the story forward but at that point, you just accept that there is no other way. In the last few minutes, we also meet his wife, Marion Ravenwood, who has filed for divorce after their son died in the Vietnam War. So, in a way, it's more of a personal ending for Indiana Jones and not meant to set up any spin-off movie with a final tease or post-credit scene. And in some ways, this is a similar emotional ending in No Time To Die of a character spanning several decades. <br><br>
				
				If you are someone who has seen previous Indiana Jones movies, then you might want to watch this in theatres but if you are a casual fan then you could wait till it arrives on streaming as well.
