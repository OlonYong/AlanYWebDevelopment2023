		<h1 class="heading">My review</h1>
			<p id="review">
				Peter Jackson has done a really great job. The story picks up from the part where Gandalf was attacked, except this time it happens from the other point of view. This not only helps the viewer remember an incident that was important from the previous movie, but also makes it interesting by not showing the exact same shots again. While previously we believed Gandalf to be just a weak old man, over here he turned out to be a strong wizard. This is the reason why it paid off to see him return as Gandalf the White. <br><br>
				The thing I really like about Gandalf is that he is a perfect balance of powerful and emotional character. In one moment, he is being spun around by Saruman where he is crying like a frail old man, and in the very next scene he is fighting a fire dragon. In the first movie he scared Bilbo for a second by threatening him with magic if he dared to wear the ring, but immediately after he joined the Hobbits in the party. This is the trait which adds character depth to him, preventing him from being a two-dimensional person. This way we get to see him from multiple perspectives.
				The second character I'd talk about here would be Gollum. The first time I saw him I thought he's just another one of those cringy skinny characters every fantasy movie needs to have (Jar Jar from Star Wars prequels, Dobby from Harry Potter etc). But he's very different. Earlier he was just a normal person like the rest of us. However, it was the temptation of the ring that completely ruined him, not just emotionally but physically too. Now despite his immortality he wastes himself searching for an addiction he has never been able to get away from. This is the reason why despite not actually wanting to hurt Frodo, he is unable to convince himself that what he is doing is wrong. This message is very clear in the scene where he is talking to himself. <br><br>
				Speaking of the scene where Gollum talks to himself, that scene is one of the many scenes which can show the emotions that the characters wanted to express. This is something that can be done only by a good cinematography, which is something Peter Jackson was able to handle. Even though that scene is ridiculed, the point behind the scenes was to show how Gollum was feeling while planning to kill Frodo and not how he was actually looking like. There have been plenty of scenes where the characters have conversations, but I don't want to spoil the movie for you. <br><br>
				And that scene was interrupted by Sam, who is the next character I'd speak about. Sam is Frodo's best friend, and he can go to any limits to make sure Frodo is safe. He is pure of mind, which was shown in the first movie when he stopped Frodo from wearing the ring. Sam had heard that Gollum wanted to kill Frodo and even though Gollum was the only one character who could help them reach the Mountain of Doom, Sam was ready to take the risk even if it meant having to get lost. Frodo didn't trust him or rather should I say, didn't WANT to trust him. And despite being abandoned by his best friend, Sam never wasted any time to get back to saving Frodo. <br><br>
				The movie also has many battle scenes, cool CGI, shows the Fellowship of the Ring fight alongside other kingdoms while Gandalf is not there to protect them. The action, the comic timings, the CGI, the acting, everything about this movie is great. The only mistake I made watching this was that I watched the theatrical cut of this movie. Because of this I missed a very important (and cool) scene.
